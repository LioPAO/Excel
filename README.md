A projet set to monitor and track a 2-Star Hotel's inventory. The owner required a detail run down of stock to have an approximate estimation of what was BOUGHT, SOLD AND STOCKED. 
The current setup is such that, monthly reports are generated by hotel management and submitted for appreciation. These are stored in BILAN MENSUEL 
BILAN HOTEL serves as a master file that aggregates all monthly entries and does so automatically using power query. A simple refresh buttom will add and generate results for the period. 
This setup was tailored made based on owner's requirement and can has be modeled to accomodate changes.
